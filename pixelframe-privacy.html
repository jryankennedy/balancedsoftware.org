		<h1>Privacy Policy for PixelFrame</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: August 30, 2025</p>
		<p style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;">Overview</p>
    <p>Balanced Software, LLC ("we," "us," or "our") operates the PixelFrame mobile application ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our App.</p>
    <p>The short version: PixelFrame does not collect, store, or share any of your personal information.</p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;">Photo Access</p>
    <p>PixelFrame requests permission to access your device's photo library solely to allow you to select and display photos within the app.</p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;">Third-Party Services</p>
    <p>PixelFrame does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The only third-party service interaction occurs through Apple's In-App Purchase system when you choose to purchase the app license. Apple's own privacy policy governs any data handling related to payment processing.</p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;">Data Storage</p>
    <p>PixelFrame may store minimal technical information locally on your device (such as app settings or preferences) to ensure proper functionality.</p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;">Children's Privacy</p>
    <p>PixelFrame does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. Since our app does not collect any personal information, it is safe for users of all ages. Parents can feel confident that no personal information about their children is being collected or shared through our app.</p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;">Changes to This Privacy Policy</p>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the app after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;">Contact Us</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us at:</p>

    <p style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;">Security</p>
    <p>Although we do not collect personal information, we are committed to ensuring the security of our app. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the app's functionality and any locally stored settings from unauthorized access or alteration.</p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;">Your Privacy Rights</p>
    <p>Since we do not collect any personal information about you, there is no personal data for us to access, update, delete, or port. However, we respect your rights under applicable privacy laws:</p>
    <p>For California Residents (CCPA): You have the right to know what personal information is collected, to delete personal information, and to opt-out of the sale of personal information. Since we collect no personal information, these rights are automatically satisfied.</p>
    <p>For EU Residents (GDPR): You have rights including access, rectification, erasure, data portability, and objection to processing. Since we process no personal data, these rights are automatically satisfied.</p>
    <p>For All Users: You can uninstall the app at any time to remove any locally stored app settings.</p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;">International Users</p>
    <p>PixelFrame is available worldwide. Since we do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, there are no international data transfers or cross-border privacy concerns.</p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;">Governing Law</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy and any disputes arising from your use of PixelFrame are governed by the laws of the State of Tennessee, United States, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any legal proceedings shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in Tennessee.
